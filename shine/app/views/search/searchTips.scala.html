<h2>Search Tips</h2>

<p>
If you are looking for a single website that you believe may be in the
UK Web Archive, you can search for it via the Search tab. Use a phrase or name
that you think is most likely to be in the website and in that website alone. This
will search across all the archived websites.</p>

<p>
There are several options for narrowing your search. For example, a phrase search
uses more than one term (i.e. more than a single word). If two (or more) terms are submitted
without the use of quotes, only one of those terms need appear in the documents to produce a result.
If the terms are quoted, then only that precise string will be returned. See the <a href="#query-syntax">Query Syntax
section below</a> for full details.</p>

<p>Having submitted your query you can further refine your search using the facets on the
left-hand side of the full text search results page. This allows the matching results to be 
filtered by various properties, such as content type, collection and crawl year. For example, 
you can use the 'Refine by domain suffix' facet to limit the results set to those resources 
hosted on domains with names that share the same common suffix, such as 'co.uk', 'ac.uk' or 'com'.</p>

<p>
Note that all queries are case-insensitive.
